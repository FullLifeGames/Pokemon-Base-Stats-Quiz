## 🔍 Key Features Explained

### Five Quiz Modes

**Base Stats Quiz**
- Identify Pokémon from HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed
- Smart selection accepts any Pokémon with matching stats
- Hints reveal types and abilities

**Learnset Quiz**
- Identify Pokémon from their learnable moves
- Moves grouped by type and sorted alphabetically
- Generation-aware (shows only moves available in selected generation)
- Base forms only (no alternate forms like Pikachu-Alola)
- Auto-retries if Pokémon has no moves in selected generation

**Damage Calc Quiz**
- Guess damage percentage from competitive battle scenarios
- Interactive slider interface (0-110% with 1% increments)
- Shows detailed matchup: attacker, defender, move, abilities, items, natures, EVs
- ±5% tolerance for correct answers
- Uses real competitive sets from Smogon for Gen 1-9
- Filters out CAP Pokémon and non-standard metagames
- Dynamic loading with code-splitting per generation (saves bandwidth)
- Respects all settings (generation range, fully evolved, mega filter)
- Possibilitiy to filter between Singles and VGC
- **Field Effect Detection**: Automatically triggers weather and terrain effects based on Pokémon abilities:
  - Weather abilities: Drought (Sun), Drizzle (Rain), Sand Stream (Sandstorm), Snow Warning (Snow), and more
  - Terrain abilities: Grassy Surge, Electric Surge, Psychic Surge, Misty Surge
  - Defender's ability takes precedence when both Pokémon have conflicting field effects
  - Active effects displayed with icons (☀️🌧️🌪️❄️ for weather, 🌿⚡🔮🌸 for terrain)
  - Field effects integrated into damage calculations via @smogon/calc

**Weight & Height Quizzes**
- Identify Pokémon by selecting the closest numeric value for weight/height
- Uses shared value-option UI across solo and VS for consistent interaction
- Supports the same generation and form filters as other quiz modes

### Smart Selection System
The Base Stats quiz doesn't require exact Pokémon names. If a Pokémon has identical base stats to the displayed stats, it's considered correct. This allows for legitimate alternatives.

### Advanced Randomization
- **Recent History Tracking**: Prevents the same Pokémon from appearing within the last 10 rounds
- **Stat-Based Grouping**: Pokémon with identical stats are grouped and weighted equally to ensure fair distribution
- **Smart Deduplication**: Avoids repetitive selections while maintaining variety

### Infinite Scroll Selection
- **Performance Optimized**: Initially loads 30 Pokémon, loads 30 more as you scroll
- **Search Integration**: Filters update instantly while maintaining scroll performance
- **Mobile & Desktop**: Consistent experience across all devices with adaptive UI

### Visual Feedback
- **Pokémon Sprites**: Full-size sprites displayed in result messages and VS mode
- **Pokémon Icons**: Compact icons in selector buttons and dropdown lists
- **Auto-Scaling**: Sprites and icons automatically scale to fit their containers
- **Responsive Sizing**: Adapts to screen size with Tailwind responsive classes

### German Localization
German Pokémon names are fetched from PokéAPI and cached in `pokemonNames.json`. The localization handles special forms like "Deoxys-Attack" properly.

### Auto-Advance Mechanism
After selection, the quiz displays results for 500ms then automatically loads the next Pokémon. Timer pauses during this transition.

### Score-Based Win Condition
Customize the difficulty by setting how many correct answers are needed to complete the quiz. Celebrating wins with a congratulations dialog.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Pokémon with identical base stats will both be accepted as correct (by design)
- Generation 9 (Paldea) is the maximum supported generation
- Some Pokémon forms may not have German names (falls back to English)
- Damage scenarios are limited to 1-110% damage range (filtered by generator)
- Learnset quiz uses base forms only (no alternate forms)
- Some older generation Pokémon may have limited competitive sets available
- VS Mode requires all players to have stable internet connections
- VS Mode uses a free PeerJS server which may have occasional downtime
- Room codes expire when all players disconnect
- VS Mode time limit is mandatory (minimum 10 seconds) to ensure fair scoring
- Host disconnection ends the match (all state managed by host)
